How to build
============

naive-chord depends on 2 other projects:

  * https://github.com/santazhang/base-utils
  * https://github.com/santazhang/simple-rpc

Checkout those 2 projects, make sure you have following directory layout:

    $WORKSPACE/base-utils
    $WORKSPACE/simple-rpc
    $WORKSPACE/naive-chord

Build and test base-utils and simple-rpc first:

    cd $WORKSPACE/base-utils
    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    ./build/unittest
    cd $WORKSPACE/simple-rpc
    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    ./build/unittest

Now you are ready to build naive-chord:

    ./waf configure
    ./waf
    ./build/unittest
